<p>
    &nbsp;The purpose of this blog is to scour the Indo-European language family
    tree on a hunt for meaning.&nbsp; The English words health, whole, and holy,
    are all etymologically related words, but which is parent to the other or
    might they be siblings, and to what degree are they the same?<br /><br />kail/hal/hol (healthy, whole, holy) >> kel (cover, keep safe) >> kul (care for) >> cus (caretaker) sol/sel/sal (single, healthy) hel, hol, hal, sal, san, sac</p><p>(PIE roots are hypothetical reconstructions reverse-engineered from the child languages of the Proto-Indo-European language which has been extinct for thousands of years and has no written evidence. Hence the use of the *.)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;Already we can see a picture not so clear.&nbsp; Were we to stop at Old English we could conclude that holy and health are the offspring of whole.&nbsp; Note also, that in Old Norse, health and whole are the same word <i>heill</i>, but going back to the Proto-Indo-European root, *<i>kailo</i>, we see the meanings: <b>whole</b>, <b>uninjured</b>, and <b>good omen</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It should be pointed out also that we did not include hale in our English words list.&nbsp; Hale, another word for healthy, one would likely put with inhale and exhale at first glance.&nbsp; The OED does not give an etymology for -hale of inhale any further back than Latin halare "to breathe".&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Checking with ChatGPT for our hunt, we see a different picture:<br /><br /></p>
  
  <div style="background-color: #333333; color: #dddddd; margin: auto; padding: 50px; width: 80%;">
    <h3>Health:</h3>
    <p>
      The PIE root for health likely involves the root <em>kailo</em> or
      <em>kailaz</em>, which referred to wholeness or being uninjured. This root
      is believed to have given rise to words related to well-being, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanskrit: <em>kalyaḥ</em> (well-being)</li>
      <li>Old English: <em>hāl</em> (whole, hale)</li>
      <li>Gothic: <em>hails</em> (whole, intact)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Holy:</h3>
    <p>
      The concept of holiness is often associated with the sacred and the divine.
      The PIE root for holy is more complex and may not have a direct equivalent,
      but it could be related to the root <em>kews-</em>, which means to honor or
      to show reverence. This root might have contributed to words with religious
      or sacred meanings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Latin: <em>custos</em> (guardian, keeper)</li>
      <li>Lithuanian: <em>kaustas</em> (sacrifice)</li>
      <li>Sanskrit: <em>havya</em> (offering)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Whole:</h3>
    <p>
      The concept of wholeness can be connected to the PIE root <em>kailo</em> or
      <em>kailaz</em> mentioned earlier. This root likely evolved to express
      notions of completeness and entirety:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanskrit: <em>śakra</em> (whole, undivided)</li>
      <li>Latin: <em>celer</em> (whole)</li>
      <li>Greek: <em>holos</em> (whole)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Here we can change gears for a second as ChatGPT has given an interesting opening with the Sanskrit śakra.&nbsp; I tried to confirm this elsewhere but have yet to find a dictionary which has the Sanskrit word sakra as "whole, undivided" but instead I find "powerful, capable" and primarily used as an epithet for Indra.&nbsp; However, I did find the Sanskrit words&nbsp;<a href="https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?qs=sak&amp;matchtype=default" target="_blank">sakh</a>, "pervade or fill completely," and suci "pure, holy, spotless"</p><p>Does this remind you of an English word that would be relevant here?<br /><br />According the OED, the English word sacred</p><p><span style="background-color: #fffcf2; color: #555555; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">"is from Old Latin&nbsp;</span><span class="foreign notranslate" style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: #fffcf2; box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">saceres</span><span style="background-color: #fffcf2; color: #555555; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">, from PIE root&nbsp;</span><span class="foreign notranslate" style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: #fffcf2; box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">*sak-</span><span style="background-color: #fffcf2; color: #555555; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;"to sanctify."

Is it possible or even plausible that Hell might be related to health or hole to whole?&nbsp; &nbsp;<p></p><p>Indeed, the words I just mentioned may be related but not as closely as their similarity in sound might suggest.&nbsp; According to the OED, Hell, hole, and hollow, all derive from a PIE root *kel meaning "hide, cover, save" from which we also get the -ceal in conceal.&nbsp; This is how Hell got its name, a place which is concealed.&nbsp; Likewise hole and hollow were associated with places covered as in a cave, a place of protection. While there are several meanings that evolved out of this root, "defense and shelter" are among them.<br /><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heaven&nbsp;</h3><p></p><p>Words in English that also derived from *kel along this line of meaning are helm, helmet, and hood.&nbsp; So, from *kel we have a meaning similar what we see in sal/salvus/salus, that is, something to keep us safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It might be the greatest irony in all of language if I could tell you that Heaven and Hell both derive from the same root, and perhaps a profound insight, but, I cannot, or not with much certainty.&nbsp; The OED gives a "perhaps" in its etymology of English heaven from the root *kem "to cover" while ChatGPT gives the root *kewb (also to cover).&nbsp; Even if we look to Latin caelum/caelestis, "sky, heaven" which is suspected to be related to Latin celare "cover", the etymology beyond Latin is uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Looking For an Idea in its Opposite</h3><p>Together, Even, Same, Balance,&nbsp;<br />sympathy<br />So far we've seen that&nbsp;<br />Before we move on, let me say that halas in Greek doesn't only mean salt, but also wisdom or prudence, as salt was a symbol of these which is fitting as we might define wisdom as that which keeps one's life from going to ruin.&nbsp; "Too, there is in Latin salus, "healthy"&nbsp;</p><p>Solo = single = syn = one, as one, together, same&nbsp;<br />alone = all one = whole<br />Persian khod (self) &gt;&gt; khoda (god) &gt;&gt; khorshid (sun)<br />The sun is the sole &gt;&gt; holos<br />self &gt;&gt; se<br />Is it a stretch to say that safe = whole, uninjured, or even holy?</p>
