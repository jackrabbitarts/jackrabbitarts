                        [the shift l > r]. The root abhro - : ‘strong, mighty ” is related to the cult of fertility hence the goddess of <br>
                        love, beauty and sexual rapture “Αφροδίτη Aphrodite” . The name of Aphrodite derived from <br>

                        In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty and sexual rapture. According <br>
                        to Hesiod, she was born when Uranus (the father of the gods) was castrated by his son <br>
                        Cronus. Cronus threw the severed genitals into the ocean which began to churn and foam <br>
                        about them. From the ἀφρός “aphros (‘sea foam") ” arose Aphrodite, and the sea carried her <br>
                        to either Cyprus or Cythera. Hence she is often referred to as Kypris and Cytherea. <br>
                        The name of Aphrodite is related to PIE Root ( enebh-2): nebh- , embh -, m̥bh- : (wet, damp; <br>
