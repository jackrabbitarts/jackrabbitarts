    <p>I currently feel I am in a liminal space.  An old life is behind me. A 
      a new life is in front of me.

    <p>The threshold I encounter is two-fold:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new way of making a living</li>
      <li>A new way of living</li>

      the avenues by which I hope to accrue income, but my creative offspring, 
      something I want to tend and see grow.

      a sample of my work in the 'Digital Painting'
