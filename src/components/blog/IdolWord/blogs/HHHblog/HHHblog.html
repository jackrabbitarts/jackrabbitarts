    &nbsp;The purpose of this blog is to scour the Indo-European language family
    tree on a hunt for meaning.&nbsp; The English words health, whole, and holy,
    are all etymologically related words, but which is parent to the other or
    might they be siblings, and to what degree are they the same?<br /><br />kail/hal/hol 
    (healthy, whole, holy) >> kel (cover, keep safe) >> kul (care for) >> cus (caretaker) 
    sol/sel/sal (single, healthy) hel, hol, hal, sal, san, sac</p>
    <p>(PIE roots are hypothetical reconstructions reverse-engineered from the child 
      languages of the Proto-Indo-European language which has been extinct for thousands 
      of years and has no written evidence. Hence the use of the *.)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;Already we can see a picture not so clear.&nbsp; Were we to stop at Old English we could conclude that 
    holy and health are the offspring of whole.&nbsp; Note also, that in Old Norse, 
    health and whole are the same word <i>heill</i>, but going back to the Proto-Indo-European root, *<i>kailo</i>, 
    we see the meanings: <b>whole</b>, <b>uninjured</b>, and <b>good omen</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It should be pointed out also that we did not include hale in our English words list.&nbsp; 
      Hale, another word for healthy, one would likely put with inhale and exhale at first glance.&nbsp; 
      The OED does not give an etymology for -hale of inhale any further back than Latin halare 
      "to breathe".&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Checking with ChatGPT for our hunt, we see a different picture:<br /><br /></p>
  
  <div style="background-color: #333333; color: #dddddd; margin: auto; padding: 50px; width: 80%;">
    <h3>Health:</h3>
    <p>
      The PIE root for health likely involves the root <em>kailo</em> or
      <em>kailaz</em>, which referred to wholeness or being uninjured. This root
      is believed to have given rise to words related to well-being, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanskrit: <em>kalyaḥ</em> (well-being)</li>
      <li>Old English: <em>hāl</em> (whole, hale)</li>
      <li>Gothic: <em>hails</em> (whole, intact)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Holy:</h3>
    <p>
      The concept of holiness is often associated with the sacred and the divine.
      The PIE root for holy is more complex and may not have a direct equivalent,
      but it could be related to the root <em>kews-</em>, which means to honor or
      to show reverence. This root might have contributed to words with religious
      or sacred meanings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Latin: <em>custos</em> (guardian, keeper)</li>
      <li>Lithuanian: <em>kaustas</em> (sacrifice)</li>
      <li>Sanskrit: <em>havya</em> (offering)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Whole:</h3>
    <p>
      The concept of wholeness can be connected to the PIE root <em>kailo</em> or
      <em>kailaz</em> mentioned earlier. This root likely evolved to express
      notions of completeness and entirety:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanskrit: <em>śakra</em> (whole, undivided)</li>
      <li>Latin: <em>celer</em> (whole)</li>
      <li>Greek: <em>holos</em> (whole)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Here we can change gears for a second as ChatGPT has given an interesting opening with the Sanskrit śakra.&nbsp; 
    I tried to confirm this elsewhere but have yet to find a dictionary which has the Sanskrit word 
    sakra as "whole, undivided" but instead I find "powerful, capable" and primarily used as an epithet for Indra.&nbsp;
     However, I did find the Sanskrit words&nbsp;
     <a href="https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?qs=sak&amp;matchtype=default" target="_blank">sakh</a>
     , "pervade or fill completely," and suci "pure, holy, spotless"</p>
     <p>Does this remind you of an English word that would be relevant here?<br /><br />
      According the OED, the English word sacred</p><p>
    <span>
      "is from Old Latin&nbsp;</span><span class="notranslate" >saceres</span>
      <span>, 
        from PIE root&nbsp;</span><span class="notranslate"  >*sak-</span>
<span>&nbsp;"to sanctify." Buck groups it with Oscan&nbsp;</span>
<span class="notranslate"  >sakrim</span>
<span>, Umbrian&nbsp;</span><span class="notranslate">sacra</span>
<span>&nbsp;and calls it "a distinctive Italic group, 
  without any clear outside connections." De Vaan has it from a PIE root&nbsp;</span>
  <span class="notranslate">*shnk-</span>
  <span>&nbsp;"to make sacred, sanctify," and finds cognates in Hittite&nbsp;</span
  ><span class="notranslate">šaklai</span>
  <span>&nbsp;"custom, rites,"&nbsp;</span>
  <span class="notranslate">zankila</span>
  <span>&nbsp;"to fine, punish.""<br /><br />
  </span>I am inclined to disagree with Buck here just looking at the Sanskrit word in question.&nbsp; 
  I think the Latin sacer should be considered against a possible Greek counterpart.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Salvation</h3><p></p><p>While we've seen the Greek holos (whole) 
  there is a word for holy in Greek which is hagia, and for health, hygieia.&nbsp; 
  Hagia might not seem similar to sacer but there is a pattern in cognates that exist between 
  Latin and Greek where the Greek word begins with H.&nbsp; For example,<br /><br />Greek helios = Latin sol (Sun)<br />
  Greek hex/hept = Latin sex/sept (six/seven)<br />Greek hyper = Latin super<br />Greek hypo = Lain sub&nbsp;<br />
  Greek hypnos = Latin somnus (sleep)<br />Greek homos = Latin similis (same)<br />Greek halma/hallomai = Latin salire (leap, gush)
  <br />Greek halas = Latin sal (salt)</p><p>Here I must pause because we have a Greek word that appears 
  similar to the English/Germanic words we started off with, <i>halas</i>.&nbsp; But how would salt be 
  related here?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Salt in the ancient world was a highly valued commodity, 
  hence the term salary derives from the Latin sal (salt) as workers were often paid in salt.&nbsp; 
  Why?&nbsp; Because there were no refrigerators.&nbsp; Salt was used to keep food from going to ruin.&nbsp; 
  So when Jesus says to his disciples, "You are the salt of the Earth." the logical interpretation 
  here is that he means they are preservatives, or saviors.&nbsp; And indeed, in Latin, 
  we have a seemingly related word in salvare "make safe, secure" from salvus "<b>uninjured</b>
  , in <b>good health</b>, <b>safe</b>" which, of course, is where we get the English "salvation," 
  as well as "save, safe".&nbsp; This would seem an obvious fit for the PIE root *kailo given above, 
  but for the PIE root of these Latin words, the OED gives <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/*sol-" 
  target="_blank">*sol </a>&nbsp;"whole, well-kept".&nbsp;<br /><br />
  The OED also gives *sol as the root of Greek holos "whole" which disagrees with what ChatGPT gave us.
  &nbsp; While the OED gives *kailo as the root of English whole, it gives *sol as the root of 
  holism which comes from Greek rather than the Germanic side of the family--.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />A variation of salvus is the Latin salus, "salvation, safety, good wish, health, and prosperity:.
  &nbsp; Salus was also the name of the Roman goddess of health.&nbsp; The Greek equivalent of this goddess
  was Hygieia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, though we see a link between Latin salus/salvus "healthy" and Greek 
  hygieia "health", both coming from *sol according to the OED, we do not see such a link 
  between the Latin sacer/sanctus and Greek hagia, only becaue the OED is not sure where they come from.&nbsp;
  &nbsp;<br /><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Hell</h3>You may have noticed that in our hunt we have 
  seen words similar to Hell, which might seem antithetical to our other finds, but I think we cannot 
  leave it out, nor its relatives in English, hole, and hollow. Is it possible or even plausible 
  that Hell might be related to health or hole to whole?&nbsp; &nbsp;<p></p><p>Indeed, the words 
  I just mentioned may be related but not as closely as their similarity in sound might suggest.&nbsp; 
  According to the OED, Hell, hole, and hollow, all derive from a PIE root *kel meaning "hide, cover, save" 
  from which we also get the -ceal in conceal.&nbsp; This is how Hell got its name, a place which is 
  concealed.&nbsp; Likewise hole and hollow were associated with places covered as in a cave, a 
  place of protection. While there are several meanings that evolved out of this root, 
  "defense and shelter" are among them.<br /><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heaven&nbsp;</h3>
  <p></p><p>Words in English that also derived from *kel along this line of meaning are helm, helmet, 
  and hood.&nbsp; So, from *kel we have a meaning similar what we see in sal/salvus/salus, that is, 
  something to keep us safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It might be the greatest irony in all of 
  language if I could tell you that Heaven and Hell both derive from the same root, and perhaps a 
  profound insight, but, I cannot, or not with much certainty.&nbsp; The OED gives a "perhaps" 
  in its etymology of English heaven from the root *kem "to cover" while ChatGPT gives the root 
  *kewb (also to cover).&nbsp; Even if we look to Latin caelum/caelestis, "sky, heaven" which 
  is suspected to be related to Latin celare "cover", the etymology beyond Latin is uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: left;">Looking For an Idea in its Opposite</h3>
  <p>Together, Even, Same, Balance,&nbsp;<br />sympathy<br />So far we've seen that&nbsp;
  <br />Before we move on, let me say that halas in Greek doesn't only mean salt, but also wisdom or prudence, 
  as salt was a symbol of these which is fitting as we might define wisdom as that which keeps one's 
  life from going to ruin.&nbsp; "Too, there is in Latin salus, "healthy"&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Solo = single = syn = one, as one, together, same&nbsp;<br />alone = all one = whole
    <br />Persian khod (self) &gt;&gt; khoda (god) &gt;&gt; khorshid (sun)<br />
  The sun is the sole &gt;&gt; holos<br />self &gt;&gt; se<br />Is it a stretch to say that safe = whole, uninjured, or even holy?</p>
  <p>I protest.
    The OED has English 'sole' (alone, single) not deriving from PIE *sol- (whole, well-kept).
    {...
    sole (adj.)
    "single, alone in its kind; one and only, singular, unique; having no husband or wife, 
    in an unmarried state; celibate," (...cut...) a word of unknown origin, perhaps related 
    to se "oneself," from PIE reflexive root *swo- (for which see so).
    ...}
    What words does the OED have derive from *sol-? 
    salvation
    safe
    solid
    solidarity
    holism
    holos (Greek: whole)
    salus (Latin: health)
    (The English "whole" and "health" are related to each other but OED has them also from a different root)
    Do none of these words imply oneness, singularity?
    The OED has it "perhaps" related to se (self) but even self implies one, as in one's self = I am one, all + one = alone = whole.
    Old English "seolf" = "self" and "same" which implies oneness.
    English "same" from Germanic lineage of words meaning "with" or "together" from PIE *sem "one; as one, together with." 
    From this same root comes Greek syn- "same, together, with" as in sympathy, symphony, etc. and Latin, 
    cum-, com-, co- "with, together" e.g. company, communicate, etc.
    Back again, this may relate to Latin sanus = "healthy, sound"
    thus possible relations
    Latin 
    salus (health)
    sanus (healthy, sound)
    sanctus (sacred)
    salvus (healthy, safe)
    solus (alone, one, only)
    solidus (solid, substantial)
    sollus (whole, full)
    summus (total, the highest part, summit)
    similus and simplex (here sim- means "likeness, resemblence" in similis but "one" in simplex, "simple" literally "one fold" , 
    one = same, one and the same) 
    sum (I am)
    cum (together, with, as one)
    To be one is to be together is to be whole is to be healthy.  Hence words associated with being apart, 
    away from, not whole, have the meaning or connotation of illness, problem, probably why de/dis- 
    (from, away from) prefix also associated with down and lack: 
    divorce
    desperate
    despair
    disease
    dysfunctional
    disrupt
    disturb
    distract.......
    Perhaps the OED associates being alone with being apart, but these two are unequal, not the same, not one with each other.</p>

    <p>
      Doing research for a blog on the relationship between healthiness, wholeness, 
      and holiness in an ancient perspective as these three ideas seem related in different 
      languages by relations of the words, i.e. the English words health, whole, and holy 
      all derive from the same root Proto-Indo-European root.
Was looking into the Greek word hygieia (health) on the suspicion it is related 
to hagia (holy), and I see that hygieia, or hygeia wasn't just the word for health 
but also the name of a goddess, or even an epithet for the Goddess, the Mother of All, 
Athena, depending on your source.  
Linked with Hygieia and her sibling Panacea, was their father, Asclepios.  Born as mortal to a deity and mortal 
woman who died at his birth in flames (like Dionysus) Asclepius was raised by a goat and a dog, 
an eventually found by a shepherd who raised him.  Ascclepius became a master of the healing arts 
and so powerful was he at his craft that he had the ability to bring the dead back to life.  
For attaining to this height, Zeus killed him, but at the request of his father, 
Apollo, placed Asclepius in the heavens as a constellation.  This is considered his apotheosis.
The symbol most associated with Asclepios is the serpent entwined rod, known simply as the 
Rod of Asclepios, which, like the Caduceus, a symbol associated with Hermes, became a symbol for medicine in general.
What do the rod and serpent have to do with medicine, or more specifically with health?
Theory:  the serpent and rod depicted together are a picture of balance.  
The rod or staff in ancient times was a symbol of authority, of God's Will and thus also of Order.  
The rod was also used for measuring and in that there is a connection as we see in the English word ruler, 
a stick used for measuring, but also a leader,  one who rules.  What does the word rule come from?  
Making straight lines.  The rod is a symbol of order because it is a straight line.
"There are no straight lines in Nature."  Not an entirely true statement but close enough that 
it's easy to see how the straight line could be a symbol for the divine realm, the timeless, 
where as the bending line or curve a symbol for the material realm, the ever-changing.  
I do not know why serpents were associated with chaos, but the hunch is,--they never stand up straight, 
but are constantly winding in curves, bending.   To bend is to change, to be rigid is to be consistent.  
But changing is also part of transformation.
While the serpent as associated with chaos and the animal part of Man, it was also 
associated with wisdom due to it shedding its skin, a symbol of being born again, and likewise, apotheosis.
In any case.  The Rod of Asclepios could be taken as a symbol of balance between order and chaos, 
or the masculine and feminine, principles, sometimes called the Marriage of Heaven and Earth, 
the straight line and the curve.  In other words, knowing when to be rigid, and knowing when to 
bend, knowing when to gather stones, and when to cast them away.

Gustav Klimt, with a serpent languidly entwined around her arm.
